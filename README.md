`BDMirrorView` is a `CAReplicatorLayer`-backed `UIView` subclass which can be used to render a live content reflection in an iOS app. If you're struggling to understand why this view exists, just think back to Cover Flow (rip..) and the reflection below each item....

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

# Features

* Render a reflection on the top, left, bottom or right-hand side of the view.
* Customise the distance of the reflection from the parent.
* Use a masking gradient, or not.

# Usage

Set the class of the UIView to `BDMirrorView` in the Storyboard, or create an IBOutlet. ðŸ™Œ

# Installation & Compatibility

`BDMirrorView` will work wherever this version of Swift will compile.

## Manual (aka Tried & True)

Download the repo and add it into your Xcode project.

## CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'BDMirrorView'
```

# Why? WHY?

No reason. Have fun!
